Testing SSH conectivity using Password and Key-based authentication
For this test to be exhaustive there are a few things that would need to be tested
in order to be thorough. We need to test an SSH loging using a valid password and an invalid password,
and make sure that we get the appropriate responses for each instance. We must also test using a valid SSH key and 
an invalid SSH key and also make sure that we get the correct results as well. 
It would be ideal for us to alos test that we can be connected through ssh through both methods both with valid and invalid
inputs. 

In order to run these tests we need to make sure we have an SSH server that allows for both password and key-based authentication.
Deploy the SSH keys we can use OpenSSH for example to run the SSH client and to host the server. 

When we are done running the test we can remove the test ssh keys.

This test passes if we can successfully connect with a correct password and a correct SSH key, if we can have multiple SSH instances at once.
This test fails if we can not login using valid credentials and if invalid credentials allow us to login.
